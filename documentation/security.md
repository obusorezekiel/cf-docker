# Security Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the CloudFormation template, as well as recommendations for enhancing security for production environments.

## Current Security Measures

### 1. Network Security
#### EC2 Security Group (EC2SecurityGroup)
- Allows inbound traffic on ports 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 8080 (custom application port), and 22 (SSH).
- Allows inbound traffic on port 3306 (MySQL) from any IP.

#### RDS Security Group (RDSDBSecurityGroup)
- Allows inbound traffic on port 3306 (MySQL) from any IP.

**Considerations**:
- The current configuration allows broad access and should be tightened for production use.

### 2. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
#### EC2 Instance Role (EC2Role)
- Provides the EC2 instance with permissions to:
  - Interact with the S3 bucket (PutObject, GetObject, ListBucket).
  - Describe RDS instances and EC2 instances.
  - Broad access to RDS resources.

**Considerations**:
- The role follows the principle of least privilege for S3 access.
- RDS permissions are overly broad and should be restricted.

### 3. Data Security
#### RDS Instance (MyRDSInstance)
- Uses MySQL 8.0.39, which includes security improvements over older versions.
- Credentials (username and password) are parameterized, allowing secure input during stack creation.

#### S3 Bucket (S3Bucket)
- Bucket policy restricts PutObject actions to the EC2 instance role.

### 4. Application Security
- The application is containerized, providing isolation from the host system.
- Database credentials are passed to the container as environment variables.

## Security Recommendations

1. **Network Security**:
   - Restrict SSH access (port 22) to known IP ranges.
   - Use a VPC with public and private subnets. Place the EC2 instance in a public subnet and the RDS instance in a private subnet.
   - Implement a bastion host for secure SSH access.
   - Use security group rules to allow database access only from the application's security group.

2. **Identity and Access Management**:
   - Further restrict the EC2 instance role permissions, especially for RDS access.
   - Implement AWS Secrets Manager for secure storage and rotation of database credentials.

3. **Data Security**:
   - Enable encryption at rest for the RDS instance.
   - Enable encryption at rest for the S3 bucket.
   - Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web exploits.

4. **Application Security**:
   - Implement HTTPS by using AWS Certificate Manager and configuring the EC2 instance or an Application Load Balancer.
   - Regularly update the Docker image to include security patches.
   - Implement logging and monitoring using CloudWatch Logs and CloudTrail.

5. **Compliance and Auditing**:
   - Enable RDS audit logging.
   - Implement S3 bucket logging.
   - Use AWS Config to assess, audit, and evaluate configurations of AWS resources.

6. **Operational Security**:
   - Implement a patch management strategy for the EC2 instance and Docker containers.
   - Use AWS Systems Manager for secure, remote management of the EC2 instance.

7. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**:
   - Enable automated backups for the RDS instance.
   - Implement cross-region replication for the S3 bucket.

By implementing these recommendations, the security posture of the application would be significantly improved, making it more suitable for a production environment. Regular security audits and updates should be conducted to maintain a strong security stance.
